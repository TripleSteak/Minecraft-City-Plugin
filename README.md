# Minecraft-City-Plugin
Some fun city-themed features I developed a while back to complement a city building project :)

Features:
- Custom NPC vendors, who sell various items with an intuitive GUI; funds taken directly from wallet.
- Custom NPC tellers and ATMs, who allow you to interact with your bank account through spoken dialogue.
- Simple banking system that keeps track of chequing account balances.
- Multiple tiers of food, with different effects and rarities.
- Ketchup and mustard dispenser that can be right clicked with a hot dog in hand.
- Custom chairs! You can finally sit in Minecraft!
- Smooth, fully functioning elevator system that can be taken between floors of a skyscraper.
- Water dispenser that refills empty cups so you never go thirsty
- Trash cans; convenient for unwanted items (you're physically not allowed to litter :P)
- Working traffic lights
- Epic gaming chairs in the offices
- Wallets! Stores cash and facilitates transactions where applicable, following a nice colour-coded item rarity system.
- Armour locking system that prevents players from wearing unintended items (e.g. retextured helmets).
- Job shrines: random tasks pop up in thematically appropriate areas (not finished implementing)

Worked on from June 2020 to July 2020.
